# Protocol: TDD (Test-Driven Development)

<!--
  SINGLE SOURCE of the TDD Protocol. Written once here; wf-init (Builder),
  wf-refresh and wf-settings READ IT from this file — none embed or paraphrase it.
  Copied VERBATIM. Dual packaging: skill/SKILL.md + .agents/protocols/wf-tdd.md.

  ASSEMBLY (applied by the Builder based on state.testing):
  - Included only if state.testing.layers has at least one layer.
  - Part 1 (intro + matrix) ALWAYS.
  - Then, if state.testing.tdd_mode == "standard": insert variants/standard.md.
    If tdd_mode == "strict": insert variants/strict.md (the standard protocol is NOT
    written; sdd-apply enforces via openspec/config.yaml → testing.strict_tdd).
  - Part 2 (Dual-loop Playwright — only if e2e layer active — + SDD Integration)
    ALWAYS when the E2E layer is active, regardless of mode.

### 🧪 TDD Protocol

Applies when testing is configured. The agent evaluates which layers are needed
based on the type of change and presents a proposal before writing any code.

## Hard Rules

- **Auto-trigger before any code**: If this skill detects that code implementation is about to happen (sdd-apply OR direct/inline implementation), it MUST automatically emit the TDD PROPOSAL BEFORE any code is written. This is a blocking gate — do not skip it.

- **CREATE TESTS (RED) before code**: After TDD PROPOSAL and user confirms coverage, CREATE TEST FILES FIRST. No production code exists before tests. This applies to both routes:
  - **force-SDD**: create tests → sdd-apply (implements code to pass tests)
  - **no-SDD**: create tests → implement code directly/inline
  
  Hard rule: Tests MUST exist and be in RED state before implementation proceeds.

- **Validate tests (GREEN) after code**: After code implementation (via sdd-apply or inline), RUN TESTS to validate they pass. GREEN state is required before proceeding. Hard rule: Do NOT declare code done or proceed to next phase without running tests.

- **After GREEN, route-specific continuation**:
  - **If force-SDD**: GREEN tests → invoke `sdd-verify` (verify against spec) → `sdd-archive`
  - **If no-SDD**: GREEN tests → done (commit, no sdd-verify/archive)
  
  Hard rule: After GREEN, follow the route-specific next step. Do NOT skip sdd-verify when force-SDD. Do NOT run sdd-verify when no-SDD.

> - **`wf-force-sdd`**: **DON'T do it in the local pre-request flow** — there is no direct local
>   implementation once SDD was explicitly requested. **BUT be careful with the mechanism (real
>   fixed bug)**: the `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL` is **interactive** (proposes coverage and waits for your
>   choice) and gentle-ai's `sdd-apply` is a **headless** phase (`user-invocable: false`: it
>   executes and returns, cannot ask you). Therefore, the proposal **CANNOT occur "inside"
>   `sdd-apply`**. Correct flow:
>     1. Request `sdd-propose` and `sdd-tasks` first from gentle-ai (so the tasks already exist).
>     2. After user confirms `wf-force-sdd`, issue the `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL` covering the tasks from `tasks.md`
>        (in batch, or grouped by phase in large changes) and **wait for the user's coverage
>        choice**.
>     4. Only then make the `sdd-apply` request with the decision **baked into the prompt** (e.g.,
>        "coverage: unit + integration + e2e") and **reference this skill (`wf-tdd`)** so
>        gentle-ai's phase executes the RED→GREEN cycle and respects the mandatory `--headed`
>        output if it generates E2E specs. How gentle-ai executes/delegates that request is its
>        own native decision for this adapter — never specify a mechanism here.
>     5. gentle-ai's phase executes headless and returns the summary (including the `--headed`
>        command), which you show the user.
>   In `strict` mode **there is NO interactive proposal**: request `sdd-apply` directly and it
>   loads `strict-tdd.md` from `openspec/config.yaml → strict_tdd: true` (RED→GREEN enforcement
>   headless).
>
> Summary: "mandatory" = the TDD ritual ALWAYS occurs at some point based on the outcome; it does
> NOT mean "always do it here and now". At `wf-force-sdd`, here and now it is NOT issued (it
> occurs later, as part of the `sdd-apply` request after `sdd-tasks` is ready).
>
> **What is the ritual according to the project MODE** (`state.testing.tdd_mode`):
> - **Standard mode** → the ritual IS the `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL`: the agent proposes the test
>   layers and the user chooses `[Apply]` / `[Skip TDD]`. **The agent does NOT decide to skip TDD on
>   its own** (even if it seems mechanical) — the skip is the user's EXCLUSIVE choice via the
>   block option. Omitting the block = violation.
> - **Strict mode** → **There is NO `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL` or skip option**; `sdd-apply` requires
>   real RED→GREEN→REFACTOR evidence per task and rejects the work if it's missing. (That's why, in
>   this protocol, "🧪 TDD PROPOSAL" always refers to the standard mode mechanism.)
> - Self-correction instruction: if you find yourself writing/editing production code
>   without having performed the TDD ritual corresponding to the mode (PROPOSAL in standard; evidence in
>   strict), STOP and do it first.

#### Coverage matrix by change type

| Change type | Unit | Integration | E2E |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logic in hook or `lib/` | ✓ | — | — |
| Component with its own state | ✓ | optional | — |
| Multi-component flow | — | ✓ | — |
| Complete user feature | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bug fix with possible regression | based on origin | — | — |
| Pure UI/styles | — | — | — |

The matrix is a guideline. If there is logic that could break silently and
the table does not cover it, the agent proposes tests anyway.

#### Playwright Dual-loop (independent of the TDD mode chosen above)

Before writing a new E2E spec, the agent evaluates whether the flow warrants
prior visual exploration with the Playwright MCP, or whether it can go directly
to writing the versioned spec. This is not a mandatory step in all cases
— forcing it always would be unnecessary ceremony in simple, well-known flows.

**Use the MCP to explore first when**:
- The flow has multiple visual states or transitions (e.g., loading,
  error, success, with animations or layout changes).
- It is the first time this interaction is being tested — there is no prior
  similar spec to confidently start from.
- The user explicitly asks for visual validation before committing
  to the spec.

**Go directly to writing the spec when**:
- The flow is a simple, well-known CRUD (create → appears in list, edit
  → updates, delete → disappears) with no complex visual states.
- A similar spec already exists in the project that can serve as a template.

If the agent decides to explore first: use the Playwright MCP to navigate,
interact, and (if applicable) capture screenshots of the real flow running on
the dev server — without writing any files yet. Once visually confirmed
that the flow behaves as expected, write the versioned spec
in `e2e/` following the normal Red-Green-Refactor cycle above.

#### ⛔ MANDATORY OUTPUT when closing a cycle with E2E specs

Applies **whenever E2E specs have been generated** (in any TDD mode). Upon completing
the (green) cycle and BEFORE declaring the task done or committing, ALWAYS show the user
the command to see them run in the browser, with the **exact path of the newly generated spec**
(never a generic command):

```
To see these tests running in the browser:
npm run test:e2e -- --headed --workers=1 --project=chromium e2e/<exact-name>.spec.ts
```

It is mandatory output, not optional: it is easy to omit due to momentum toward the commit. If
you declare "done" or commit without having shown this command (having generated E2E specs),
it is a protocol violation. It also appears as an item in `checks_before_done`.

#### wf-sdd-trigger Integration

- **`wf-no-sdd`**: the `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL` appears after user confirms the `wf-preflight`, before implementing.
- **`wf-force-sdd`**: the `🧪 TDD PROPOSAL` is issued as part of the `sdd-apply` request, per task from `tasks.md` — not to the full pipeline, and not before `sdd-tasks` is ready.
- `🧪` always comes after `🪜 wf-ladder` (if active) and after `🔍 wf-preflight`.

Full order for `wf-no-sdd`: 🪜 wf-ladder → 🔍 wf-preflight → 🧪 TDD Proposal → implementation.
Order for `wf-force-sdd` (once delegated by gentle-ai): 🪜 wf-ladder (per task) → 🧪 TDD Proposal (per task) → implementation.
